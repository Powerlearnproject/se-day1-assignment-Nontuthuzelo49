#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is a way of developing, designing, testing and maintaining software systems using engineering principles and techniques. Sofware engineering is important because it meets user needs, ensure efficiency, and delivers high-quality, reliablle and scalable software that functions well across different platforms and environment

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Mastering the Machine (1956–1967)- The term software engineering had not yet been coined. Code development was strongly influenced by outside forces. The main purpose of any piece of software was to optimize exploitation of the limited hardware resources. 
-  Mastering the Process (1968–1982)- The first software crisis in this stage led to the birth of software engineering. The aim was to reduce risk during development and improve quality and productivity. Software development methodologies appeared to define and monitor software building.
-  Mastering the Productivity (2002–2010)- Most software systems created in this stage are called management information systems. They were designed to be an important part of business management in large companies. This has led to a need for the methodologies to be adapted by increasing the abstraction levels in software engineering tasks up to the abstraction level in which the problem is described.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- The first phase involves planning and requirement analysis. This is where the project scope is defined, and the requirements are gathered from stakeholders, customers, and market surveys. The information collected forms the foundation of the project.
- Defining Requirements - In this phase, all the requirements for the software are specified in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document. This document is approved by stakeholders and serves as a reference for the subsequent phases.
- Designing Architecture - Based on the SRS, the software's architecture is designed. Multiple designs are created and evaluated, and the most practical and logical design is chosen for development. This design is documented in the Design Document Specification (DDS).
- Development - The development phase is where the actual coding takes place. Developers use programming languages and tools to create the software according to the design specifications. This phase requires adherence to coding standards and protocols.
- Testing - After development, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any defects. Testing ensures that the software meets the quality standards and requirements specified in the SRS.
- Deployment and Maintenance - Once the software passes all tests, it is deployed to the production environment. The deployment may be done in phases to ensure smooth integration. After deployment, the software is maintained to fix any issues that arise and to implement any necessary updates or enhancements.
- Conclusion

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall is an approach to project management and software development that follows a linear sequence of events. Each phase is completed before moving on. 
  > Supports all planning to be completed up front with a clear roadmap for every stage of the project.
  > Utilizes a clear, structured approach.
  > Easy to track progress, identify risks, and manage project budgets.
  > Project manager holds significant authority over the project, plan, and value delivery.
- Agile is an approach to project management, specifically software development projects, that prioritizes collaboration, continuous delivery and customer feedback.
  > Can handle changes to requirements along the way, regardless of size.
  > Shorter feedback loops mean faster ability to pivot.
  > Clear visibility of current/active work items and ability to see progress on tasks over time.
  > Support for engineering discipline and upfront testing, improving quality.
  
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developers use their programming skills to create software. They follow the guidelines established by the product owner. They are responsible for creating proper software documentation, and developing updates and upgrades, and resolving issues for existing software. They are responsible for writing code, debugging, collaborating with team members, implementing new features and maintaining code quality.
- A Quality Assurance Engineer identifies bugs, system flaws, and other software issues in your product before it is released to the public. They also confirm that your products or services meet company and industry standards. Other duties include overseeing product problem resolutions, running software compatibility tests, and driving product improvements.
- The Project manager plays a crucial role in the software development team, overseeing the development, organization, and delivery of a project. They are responsible for breaking down the project into manageable parts, distributing tasks among the team members, and ensuring that contracts, budgets, and timeframes are met. Ensuring effective communication and collaboration among team members.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software suite that combines various tools, editors, and utilities into a single unified platform. Its primary purpose is to facilitate software development by offering an integrated set of features, including code editors, compilers, debuggers, version control systems, and more. IDEs are designed to enhance developer productivity and provide a seamless workflow for writing, testing, and maintaining code.
  ~ Examples of IDE -  Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse,  PyCharm and Visual Studio Code.
  ~ Importance of IDE
   > Enhanced Productivity: IDEs boost productivity by automating repetitive tasks, providing code suggestions, and offering real-time error checking. Developers can write code more efficiently and focus on solving complex problems rather than dealing with mundane coding details.
   > Code Assistance and Auto-Completion: IDEs provide intelligent code assistance, offering auto-completion suggestions for variables, functions, and libraries. This feature accelerates coding and reduces syntax errors.
   >  Integrated Debugging: Debugging is an integral part of software development. IDEs come equipped with robust debugging tools, allowing developers to step through code, inspect variables, and identify and fix issues more effectively.
   > Version Control Integration: IDEs often integrate version control systems like Git, allowing developers to track changes, collaborate with team members, and manage project versions seamlessly.
   > Project Organization: IDEs help manage complex projects by organizing code files, resources, and dependencies within a structured environment. This aids in maintaining code readability and ensures a more organized development process.
   > Code Refactoring: IDEs facilitate code refactoring, enabling developers to restructure code without altering its functionality. This process enhances code quality, improves readability, and reduces technical debt.
   
- Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
  Examples of VCS is Git, Subversion (SVN) and Mercurial
- Importance of VCS:
  > Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
  > Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification.
  > Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
  > Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Managing Complexity- Software projects can become highly complex, making it difficult to understand and manage the entire codebase.
  Solution: Break down projects into smaller, manageale components and use design patterns.
- Meeting Deadlines- Tight deadlines and time constraints can put pressure on software engineers to deliver high-quality software quickly.
  Solution: Adopt Agile methodologies to deliver incremental updates, prioritize tasks and maintain open communication with stakeholders to set realistic expectations. Time management and planning tools can also be helpful.
- Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
- Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code, such as functions or methods, in isolation from the rest of the application. Helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process. Promotes code quality and reliability.
- Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between different components or modules of the application. Helps catch errors that may not be apparent during unit testing. Ensures that the combined components function correctly as a whole.
- System testing involves testing the entire integrated application as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements. Ensures that the complete system functions correctly and meets the requirements. Provides a comprehensive assessment of the system's quality.
- Acceptance testing is performed to determine whether the application meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment. Validates that the software fulfills the business requirements and user needs. Provides confidence to stakeholders that the application is ready for production.Helps identify any last-minute issues or improvements before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It is more like giving clear instructions to a smart assistant.
Importance: Prompt engineering helps by making your questions clear, accurate, efficient and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague Prompt - " Tell me about android and iOS "
  Improved Prompt - " Discuss the differences in security features and user privacy measures between Android and iOS operating systems. "
  why the improved prompt is more effective:
- The prompt is now clear as it removes the vagueness by clearcly indicating the topic of comparison.
- It is now detail oriented as it requests about particular features, ensuring a more relevant and informative response.
